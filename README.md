# MS274 Final Project Abstract
  For my final project, I will be investigating the relationship between sea surface temperature, primary production, and jellyfish blooms in Monterey Bay, CA. Currently, in the field
of marine ecology there is much debate revolving around the response of marine gelatinous megazooplankton to various effects of climate change. Some evidence shows an increase
in seasonal aggregation of many species of marine jellies in nearshore enclosed and semi-enclosed environments, such as bays and estuaries, while other data may suggest no change or
even a decline in numbers. This disagreement of conclusions within the scientific community most likely stems from the inherent difficulty of observing and quantifying these jellyfish
blooms, along with the differences in possible responses to the many physical, chemical, and biological factors that are shifting in the ocean as a result of climate change. By analyzing
various datasets, I aim to demonstrate a correlation, if one exists, between changing ocean conditions and aggregations of common species of jellies found in Monterey Bay, such as
the brown sea nettle (_Chrysaora fuscescens_) and the moon jelly (_Aurelia labiata_), among others.
